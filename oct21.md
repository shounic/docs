a bit ago we made a thing that auto-reconnects people when server crashes. it got updated to possibly be better? just test that real quick:
connect 103.163.186.60:27015

also the custom map we tested last time, the server didn't record a stv demo (in-game recording where you can fly around). if i'm already streaming i might as well play it again i guess /shrug
