**summary**

chat will democractically make a 24 player koth map

i tried to schedule the stream early but this is probably going to take multiple streams or something idk. if it happens it'll be in subsequent days

**how it work?**

chat's decisions on what to do with the map will be decided through polls held on https://discord.gg/E2zYGKAH3q

the literal mapping in hammer will be done by sho, who has only used it for degenerate and unethical purposes. please feel free to give me advice or help in chat lol

idk is there anything else to clarify?
