hi i'm going to do a dumbass experiment for next video. the idea is basically how many cheaters can beat how many real people :^)

so it'll go like 1v99, 2v98, 3v97, 4v96, etc. 

we have completed the technical ground work for this but i need to make sure it works so that's what we're doing today.

also i gotta come up with the "format" of the experiment, ie what maps to play, how many, etc so i'll also have a discussion about that at some point. 

might also test a plugin i made to fix certain gamemodes disrespecting the time limit: ie after the server time limit is up, the map goes into overtime and doesn't properly end. this is to improve le gaming experience on the trenches server
