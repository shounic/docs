someone gave me the idea of - how many aimbots to win vs the most amount of people, ie like idk 5 cheaters vs 95 players. wanted to talk about the limitations of the plugins (i'm not going to distribute genuine cheats, but also what is available as sourcemod plugins are pretty limited) and how people felt about those limitations. do i gotta spend time upgrading the plugin? maybe it's good enough? /shrug

2nd thing i wanted to try was proximity vc which someone has apparently already made a sourcemod plugin for a long time ago ðŸ‘€
want to do a small test to see if it even works??

finally on the 100 player tf2 server discord we had a vote on The Engineer Problem and short circuit was blamed as the problem by a wide margin. want to try out different costs for the right click
