hi. we created a crash handler: if the server crashes, it'll make everyone reconnect and restart on the last played map. this should be a lot less disruptive to the gaming experience if shit happens.
2. similarly, you can use this principle to do this: make everyone reconnect, kill the server, and come back pretty quick and seamlessly - for scheduled restarts to avoid memory leak crashes

i need to test these things with real people now
