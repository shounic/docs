the next video i'm making is an experiment to find out how many cheaters it takes to beat how many humans. 1v99, 2v98, etc, adding one each time, over many rounds until we hit the magical breaking point / threshold. (when is this experiment? probably tomorrow but just pay attention to discord/the community tab on my yt channel to find out, cause i'll need to ask people to show up since we need a bunch of people)

yesterday's stream i tested out the plugins and those all work fine, but it seems that the second server i wanted to use for this, the server itself is insufficient (it randomly kicked everyone from the game (read: null routing)) so i have procured another server and now i need to just test and see if that works well, if it'll do anything weird, etc. as a result we're just fucking around on tf2. 

i will probably turn on this wacky bhop plugin that also removes the speedcap and go wild. ye that's it.
