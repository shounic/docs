experiment time! how many cheaters can beat how many humans?


because server limits are still 100, it will progress via slowly taking people away from the human team: ie 1v99 -> 2v98 -> 3v97 -> 4v96, etc. until we hit the magic threshold where the cheaters start winning. the pace of me adding cheaters/increasing cheater team size will basically be down to my discretion and judgement.

players don't need to do anything special, we have a plugin to simulate cheats. cheaters are given silent aim (aimbot) and wallhacks. the aimbot only works on hitscan weapons (fire bullet) so no projectile cheats (why no? see faq) (as a cheater aimbot is enalbed by default so you don't have to do anything)

regular players won't have voice chat but they will have text chat. cheaters will be in a discord voice chat :D (subsequently if you get randomly picked to be a cheater but you can't speak i might reroll it)



faq:

why no projectile aimbot? that's way more complicated and it's just more stuff that needs to be done. if i HAD to add that then i might not do this experiment in the first place. it's about opportunity cost, time vs reward/gain, etc.

why is wallhack color white instead of anything else? technical limitation, white is LITERALLY the only possible option
