**summary**

chat will democractically make some sort of payload map for 100 players (seriously)
you guys can throw but the stakes are that if the map is awful i'm just not going to add it to the trenches (the 100 players server). choose wisely

dec6th: day 1 . . . . . . . . dec7th onward: extra days if needed (probably needed) (streams start 12pm EST)

**how it work?**

chat's decisions on what to do with the map will be decided through polls held on https://discord.gg/E2zYGKAH3q

the literal mapping in hammer will be done by sho, who has only used it for degenerate and unethical purposes. please feel free to give me advice or help in chat lol

idk is there anything else to clarify?
