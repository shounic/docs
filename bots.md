there is another movement on the horizon to spam valve about the bots issue and i think there's some things i should perhaps point out?

the big part is that i think given anti cheat is kinda unrealistic for them to fix, this basically logically brings us to actually shitty band aid fixes that could serve to harm the game and not do much. ie: tf2 is a 50$ game now, or your account needs to be 4 years old to play, etc.

question 1 is if this is even worth making into a video, but i've talked to other youtubers and they feel like this is worth saying so maybe? to me i feel like i can't discount the fact that people are actually mostly aware of this and they feel the risk is worth taking? idk?

if the answer is yes to the above then the rest of the stream would be me arguing with chat to basically construct a big flow chart that'd basically be the video i end up publishing, but just more polished and explaining my thoughts in greater depth.
