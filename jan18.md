dbz has it's art pass done and is on the server now. but with its release i wanted to also put up a few custom maps onto trenches to spice it up a bit more. this stream i'm going to play maps people have suggested. but as fun as it would be to play stupid meme maps, i'm not particularly interested in wasting my time today so i'm only going to play maps that at least have the intent, and try to be a fair and balanced map. 


also in the end i am the person deciding what gets in. a map can be trying to be good, but if i feel like it ends up not being that good for 100 players i'm going to pass on it. i have a tentative goal of perhaps having 3-5 maps to add?
