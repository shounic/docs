we did some stuff that might improve server stability vs people (very very very very very aggressively) poking it. (can't be 100% certain we fixed it)

enjoy server for what it is, it might explode :3

oh also there's like two things we added that COULD POSSIBLY break at 100 players and i will have to fix that too. just writing it here so people don't panic when things get weird :)
